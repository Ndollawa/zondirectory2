## Quick notes

During the work on this project I also created [NacDB](https://github.com/vporton/NacDB) database.
During this work I developed a strategy how to accomplish reliable operations over unreliable actors
in actor model of ICP. It is a serious computer science research, I should publish this in peer review.

Streams ordering items by voting results will be implemented using
[NacDBReorder library](https://github.com/vporton/NacDBReorder) (in development).
It uses an advanced combination of data structures to add, reorder, and delete items.

## Running the project locally

If you want to test our project locally:

Set `REACT_APP_IS_LOCAL=1` in `.env`. (Local version uses the usual II instead of NFID, becuase
NFID cannot be called from localhost.)

Use the following commands:

```bash
# Starts the replica, running in the background
dfx start --background

# Deploys your canisters to the replica and generates your candid interface
make deploy-frontend
# Initializes the canisters
make init
```

Once the job completes, your application will be available at `http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}`.

If you have made changes to your backend canister, you can generate a new candid interface with

```bash
npm run generate
```

at any time. This is recommended before starting the frontend development server, and will be run automatically any time you run `dfx deploy`.

If you are making frontend changes, you can start a development server with

```bash
npm start
```

Which will start a server at `http://localhost:8080`, proxying API requests to the replica at port 4943.

### Note on frontend environment variables

If you are hosting frontend code somewhere without using DFX, you may need to make one of the following adjustments to ensure your project does not fetch the root key in production:

- set`DFX_NETWORK` to `ic` if you are using Webpack
- use your own preferred method to replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` in the autogenerated declarations
  - Setting `canisters -> {asset_canister_id} -> declarations -> env_override to a string` in `dfx.json` will replace `process.env.DFX_NETWORK` with the string in the autogenerated declarations
- Write your own `createActor` constructor
